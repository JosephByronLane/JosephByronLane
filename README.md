Hi, i program stuff sometimes.

I'm not quite sure what to put in here; this isn't a problem I've thought how to solve.

I can solve many other problems though, mainly through programming and bashing my head.

Here is some of the things I have experience in:
- Front end development (Angular, Next.JS, CSS, TypeScript, HTML)
- Back end Development (Node.js, Flask, Django)
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner Cloud, Terraform)
- CI/CD (Github Actions, Docker, Azure DevOps, Python)
- 3D DCC (Blender, Houdini, Python scripting for pipelines, Blackmagic Fusion, Substance Painter)
